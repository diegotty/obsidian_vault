## amdahl’s law
each program has some part of it which *cannot* be parallelized (e.g. I/O operations, sending/receiving data over the network, …). we calculate this fraction as the *serial fracttion* $1-\alpha$

*amdahl’s law* says that the speedup is limited by the serial fraction

we can divide $p$ by $n$ (by parallelizing it), however we can’t speedup $s$

so we can’t obtain the ideal speedup we talked about earlier

$$
T_{\text{parallel}}(p) = (1-\alpha)T_{\text{serial}}+\alpha \frac{T_{\text{serial}}}{p}
$$
