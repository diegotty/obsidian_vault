## message authentication
we encrypt the whole message and keep part of it

in one-way hash functions, we only encrypt 

### hash functions
hash functions have the following properties:
- can be applied to a block of data of any size
- produces a fixed-length output
- $H(x)$ is relatively easy to compute for any given $x$
- one-way or pre-image resistan
# public key encryption
anyone encrypts with the public, and only owner can decrypt it, with its private
- and viceversa !!!! if i crypt with my private key, anyone will be able to decrypt it with my public

keys need to be huge. thousands of bits !


public key is used to send the symmetric key that is used to crypt the files ! because the public key is too bih


slide 29: used to pair user-public key and send it to someone, and we use a CA to crypt the message. so its for bobâ€™s key verification.

CPU has some kind of random / unpredictable part used to make random numbers
