## message authentication
we encrypt the whole message and keep part of it

in one-way hash functions, we only encrypt 

### hash functions
hash functions have the following properties:
- can be applied to a block of data of any size
- produces a fixed-length output
- $H(x)$ is relatively easy to compute for any given $x$
- one-way or pre-image resistan
# public key encryption
anyone encrypts with the public, and only owner can decrypt it, with its private
- and viceversa !!!! if i crypt with my private key, anyone will be able to decrypt it with my public
