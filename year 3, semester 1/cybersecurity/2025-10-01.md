# cryptographic concepts
## symmetric encryption
symmetric encryption (or single-key encryption) is the universal technique for providing confidentiality for transmitted or stored data
the two requirements needed for secure use are:
- strong encryption algorithm
- sender and receiver must have obtained copies of the secret key in a secure fashion and must keep the key **s

**TLS**: one asymmetric key, and we generate a new symmetric key for every communication
