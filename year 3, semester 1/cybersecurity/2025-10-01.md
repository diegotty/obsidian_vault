# cryptographic concepts
## symmetric encryption
symmetric encryption (or single-key encryption) is the universal technique for providing confidentiality for transmitted or stored data
the two requirements needed for secure use are:
- strong encryption algorithm
- sender and receiver must have obtained copies of the secret key in a secure fashion and must keep the key **secure**

**TLS**: one asymmetric key, and we generate a new symmetric key for every communication


if the key is too small, yoiu can intercept the ciphertext and brute force the key

standard key length is 128bits


vulnerability: the same blocks get encrypted into the same ciphertext

#### attacking symmetric encryption
**cryptoanalytic attack**: tries to shrink the pool of possible keys to brute force
**AES** (**advanced encryption standard**) is the most popular and widely used symmetric encryption algorithm in the modern IT industry
- 128-bit block cipher
- 128, 129 or 256-bit secret keys

**DES** (**data encryption standard**) is another standard that is now considered insecure
- 64-bit block cipher
- 56-bit secret key

stream cipher: working on single bits/ bytes. encrypting "almost at runtime", processing elements continously
