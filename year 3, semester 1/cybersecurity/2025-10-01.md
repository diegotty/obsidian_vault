# cryptographic concepts
## symmetric encryption
symmetric encryption (or single-key encryption) is the universal technique for providing confidentiality for transmitted or stored data
the two requirements needed for secure use are:
- strong encryption algorithm
- sender and receiver must have obtained copies of the secret key in a secure fashion and must keep the key **secure**

**TLS**: one asymmetric key, and we generate a new symmetric key for every communication


if the key is too small, yoiu can intercept the ciphertext and brute force the key

standard key length is 128bits


vulnerability: the same blocks get encrypted into the same ciphertext

#### attacking symmetric encryption
**AES**
