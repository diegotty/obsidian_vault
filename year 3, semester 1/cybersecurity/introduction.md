>[!def] cybersecurity
>prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic communicaiton systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its **availability**, **integrity**, **authentication**, **confidentiality**, and **nonrepudiation**

the key concepts of security 
## C.I.A.
the acronym **C.I.A.** stands for: 
### confidentiality 
>[!def] definition
>avoiding unauthorized disclosure of information, protecting data and providing access for those who are allowed to see it, while disallowing others from learning anything about its content

the tools used to guarantee confidentiality are:
- **encryption**: the transformation of information using an **encryption key**, so that the transformed information can only be read using the **decryption key** (both keys are secret, and in some cases might be the same key)
- **access control**: rules and policies, that limit access to confidential information to those people that need to know
- **authentication**: the determination of the identity or role that someone has. this can be done in a number of different ways, but is usually a combination of: something the person **has**, **knows** and **is**
- **authorization**: the determination if a person or system is allowed access to resources, based on an **access control** policy
- **physical security**: the establishment of physical barriers to limit access to protected computational resources (faraday cages !!)
### integrity
>[!def] definition
>the property that something has not been altered in an unauthorized way

tools used to guarantee integrity are:
- **backups**: the periodic archiving of data
- **checksums**: 
### availability
