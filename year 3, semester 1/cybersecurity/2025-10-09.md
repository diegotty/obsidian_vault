interpretation of knowledge based programs

sum and product problem !
- we solve it by putting if-clauses, …

the goal to knowledge based programs is to have multi agent systems (agents work together to solve smn), that abstract from how 
(1a)
$K_{s}$: $S$ knows 
|| : choice (smn not deterministic)

we fix what the agents can observe: $S$ observes $sbit \in \{0,1\}$, $ack \in \{0,1\}$, $R$ observes  $rval \in \{0,1 , bottom\}$
$K_{a}\phi$: ” $\phi$ hold in all states reach in any protocol executino, that agent $a$ cannot distinguish observations from the current state”

$a$ says: if $sbit$ is one, $rval$ cannot be $0$ !! it can be 1, or bottom. but not zero. it would not be consistent with the information i have

knowing: i have no evidence that $\phi$ could be wrong

the possible states depend on what is reachable, which depends on what is known !
