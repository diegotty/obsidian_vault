# SPI screen project

SPI(Serial Peripheral Interface): a synchronous serial data protocol used by microcontrollers for communicating with one or more peripheral devices quickly over short distances.

it operates on a master/slave (controller/peripheral) “””theory””””

With an SPI connection there is always one Controller device (usually a microcontroller) which controls the peripheral devices. Typically there are three lines common to all the devices:

- **CIPO (Controller In Peripheral Out)** - The Peripheral line for sending data to the Controller
- **COPI (Controller Out Peripheral In)** - The Controller line for sending data to the peripherals
- **SCK (Serial Clock)** - The clock pulses which synchronize data transmission generated by the Controller
and one line specific for every device
- **CS (Chip Select)** - the pin on each device that the Controller can use to enable and disable specific devices.
When a device's Chip Select pin is low, it communicates with the Controller. When it's high, it ignores the Controller. This allows you to have multiple SPI devices sharing the same CIPO, COPI, and SCK lines.
