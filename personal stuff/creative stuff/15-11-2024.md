so video
the thing is, videos are cool
ive always liked making videos
now i kinda get tied up with the idea of trying very hard to make videos n going to work as like a dp or smn. cos its the highest degree n shit. but maybe not. maybe i just make videos bc i like them and try stuff and spice it up and if i feel like it i can try to make smn out of it. not a job maybe, just open up opportunities, gathering some experience, meeting some people. anything. it will not be wasted

i know that at some point iâ€™d love to make music 4 my videos, to truly make something out of nothing. i like using music i discover but i also would love to make music (rapper is too cliche and im not good at talking)

matter fact, i dont want to talk much in my videos either. like, no talking heads shit. or filming content where i say stuff. it i say stuff, its to help the story in some way. to show a character, to get smn across, but its just a device. a thing i can have fun trying to insert in different ways.
